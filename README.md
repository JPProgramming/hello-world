# hello-world
Greetings to the things on this earth; People, Plants, I don't know.... 

I'm Joshua Plaat, the youngest son in a family of six children. One of my favorite video games is Rainbow Six: Siege.
Twelve has always been my favorite number, no real reason as to *why*, except it was the age it was when I had received my first computer.
